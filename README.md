lego-linux-drivers
==================

LEGO MINDSTORMS and LEGO WeDo drivers for Linux from the [ev3dev project].

These drivers can be used on the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Intelligent brick as part
of the [ev3dev kernel] or on anything else that runs Linux with the [dkms
package]. This repository is included as a submodule in both of the linked
repositories, so you probably don't want to clone this repository directly.
Follow the links for more information.

You can also browse the online [documentation].
